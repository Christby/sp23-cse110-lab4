Question 1: values added: 20

Question 2: final result: 20

Question 3: values added: 20

Question 4: the code returns an error because the variable "result" is out of scope. let is block scope so there's an error when we call it outside the if statement where it's defined. 

Question 5 and 6: the code returns an error because the value of const variables cannot be changed. So there's a TypeError that says "Assignment to constant variable".
